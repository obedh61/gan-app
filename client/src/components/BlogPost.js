          History of the Montessori Method
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The Montessori method was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in the early 20th century.
          Her educational approach focuses on self-directed learning, respect for the child, and
          fostering independence from a young age. Montessori was the first Italian woman to become
          a doctor, and throughout her career, she observed how children could learn naturally if
          provided with the right environment. This educational approach spread quickly around the
          world and remains one of the most influential methodologies in modern education.

          Differences with Traditional Methods
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Unlike traditional methods, which are often teacher-centered and focused on rote learning,
          the Montessori method places the child at the center of the learning process. Children
          choose their own pace and activities, encouraging deeper and more personalized learning.
          In Montessori classrooms, the environment and materials are arranged to foster exploration
          and independent discovery.
